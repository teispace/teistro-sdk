# Status

The living tracker. Read this first in any session; update it before ending
one. It answers four questions: what is done, what is being done now, what
comes next, and what happened in each session.

**Project phase:** Phase 0, Discovery and decisions; the decisions are
made, the spikes are next.
**Repository:** https://github.com/teispace/teistro-sdk (public,
Apache-2.0, created 2026-09-04). `main` is protected: pull requests with
the `fast-check` status, linear history. Changes land by branch, pull
request (the `dco` and `fast-check` jobs), rebase merge.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-04, end of the third session (spike 1 done: the
golden-vector export, 115 baseline fixtures over 55 charts in
`fixtures/baseline/`, the fixtures gate, the golden-vectors page).

## How to resume

1. Read this file, then `QUESTIONS.md` (every decision, one open question).
2. The local checkout is the repository root; `cargo xtask check-docs`
   and `cargo deny check` must pass before any commit; commits are
   signed off (`git commit -s`) with Conventional Commits subjects; the
   clean-room policy (`CLEAN_ROOM.md`) is binding.
3. The next task is spike 2 below. Spike 1 is done: its fixtures are in
   `fixtures/baseline/` (read `fixtures/README.md` before touching them;
   `cargo xtask check-fixtures` is their gate); the export script lives
   inside the baseline engine's own repository, in that repository's
   language, uncommitted there unless the maintainer asks, and is run
   again only for a deliberate corpus version bump.

## Done

- 2026-09-04: In-depth analysis of the baseline engine's backend (the reference and
  minimum bar). Recorded in `01-research/baseline-engine/`.
- 2026-09-04: Surface read of Teimeris (the default native ephemeris and
  the model for rigour and generated bindings).
- 2026-09-04: Web research on competitor feature sets and platform
  technology (Diplomat, UniFFI, ICU4X, MessageFormat 2, docs frameworks,
  WebAssembly, next-intl, slang, VSOP87 and ELP theories, Astronomy
  Engine, Swiss sidereal modes).
- 2026-09-04: Documentation written and revised: 86 pages (vision,
  research, architecture, roadmap, decisions, guidelines, living files).
- 2026-09-04: Twenty-five questions put to the maintainer and all
  decided; fifteen ADRs, fourteen accepted (0007, the binding generator,
  waits for the spike).
- 2026-09-04: The quality bar made binding (`05-testing/01-quality-bar.md`,
  ADR-0015) and landed through pull request #1, which proved the `dco` and
  `fast-check` path; `main` is at two commits.
- 2026-09-04: Open-source scaffolding: Apache-2.0 licence, `NOTICE`,
  `DCO`, Contributor Covenant 2.1, security policy, governance,
  `CODEOWNERS`, issue and pull request templates, RFC process, the Rust
  workspace with the `xtask` crate holding the documentation gate
  (`cargo xtask check-docs`) and the DCO check (`cargo xtask check-dco`),
  and the `fast-check` workflow (format, lint, tests, gates). Repository
  created and configured.
- 2026-09-04 (second session): eight further decisions recorded and
  accepted (ADR-0016 exact classification and periods, 0017 kernel and
  table, 0018 evidence ranks and mark-and-continue, 0019 clean room and
  licence containment, 0020 calculation version and provenance, 0021 the
  reference-accuracy ephemeris path, 0022 the determinism contract and
  the conformance repository, 0023 type safety in every binding); five
  design pages written in Phase 0 because they are retrofit-hostile
  (`03-design/`: exact arithmetic, dasha kernels with 56 systems as rows,
  the varga kernel, strength schemes, the rules engine v2); the
  verification-cruxes register (26 open items); `CLEAN_ROOM.md`,
  `deny.toml` with `cargo deny` in the fast check, library lints, the
  forbidden-terms gate extended; principles 16 to 18; the roadmap,
  quality bar, data model, API conventions, binding, performance,
  calendar, localisation, extensibility, guideline and glossary pages
  revised accordingly; `08-adding-a-dasha-system.md` written.
- 2026-09-04 (third session): spike 1 done. The golden-vector export
  script written in the baseline engine's repository and run: 55 charts
  (48 chosen for zone, latitude, altitude and data-range hostility, 7
  placed by search to the second at classification boundaries in the
  topocentric frame), 115 fixtures under 13 settings profiles, 8.9 MB,
  in `fixtures/baseline/` with a manifest; `fixtures/README.md` (layout,
  provenance, the chart set, the profiles, the schema, ten baseline
  conventions for the deliberate-difference registry);
  `fixtures/tolerances.json` (provisional, keyed by field and provider
  class); `cargo xtask check-fixtures` in the fast check;
  `05-testing/01-golden-vectors.md` as the spike's result page; the
  roadmap, testing map, glossary, layout and the varga and dasha design
  pages updated.

## Decided (all on 2026-09-04)

Rust core with a C ABI. Generated bindings with a parity gate, generator
chosen by spike. v1.0 is baseline parity with Western and Hellenistic
designed in. Apache-2.0 open core. Teispace owns all baseline engine content and
the baseline engine will migrate onto the SDK. A built-in analytic ephemeris in three
tiers (`standard` default) ships in v1 as its own phase. The SDK owns the
entire astronomy layer above raw positions; provider overrides
`prefer-native` by default. Calendars at least at the baseline engine's level in v1.
Teistro Intl as the single localisation standard (base locale `en-Latn`,
JSON, `i18n/<locale>/<namespace>.json`), offered to consumers too.
Fumadocs. British spelling. Precision-first `f64`. Two-person team,
public repository. Teimeris updated as needed. Names as recommended.
Binding order Node native, wasm, Dart/Flutter, Python, Rust, Java. DCO and
Conventional Commits. Eclipses and the full star catalogue in v1.x.
Everything we author is Rust, tooling included (`cargo xtask`). The
quality bar (tests, benchmarks, memory and leak checks, size and coverage
gates) is part of "done" for every module (ADR-0015). Second session:
`f64` astronomy with canonical nanoarcsecond angles, exact integer
classification and exact rational dasha spans (ADR-0016); one kernel per
family with systems as cited rows, falsified before code, and a lazy dasha
cursor (ADR-0017); evidence ranks with V/T/S marks and refusal of
unsourced variants (ADR-0018); a clean-room policy, a licence allow list
and adapter containment (ADR-0019); a calculation version and the
extended envelope (ADR-0020); the IAU routines as an ERFA port, a DE file
reader and a DE-refit `reference` tier (ADR-0021); byte identity across
architectures by hash and a separate CC0 conformance repository
(ADR-0022); type safety with generated, documented surfaces in every
binding (ADR-0023).

## Now

- Phase 0 spike 2, binding toolchain: one context, one settings struct,
  one batch call returning a tree, one port callback (positions),
  generated by A (C ABI plus IDL plus generators, reusing Teimeris's
  extractor) and by B (Diplomat) into Node and Dart; measured for code
  volume, callback and marshalling cost, idiomatic quality and the typed
  surface each can emit (ADR-0023). Result as ADR-0007.

## Next

1. Spike 2 as above (it is "Now"); its measurements go into ADR-0007 and
   `02-architecture/07-binding-architecture.md`.
2. Spike 3, ephemeris port: the port trait with positions-only
   requirement, the Teimeris vtable adapter, a `sweph` host adapter, frame
   completion for one body, the conformance kit prototype.
3. Spike 4, Teistro Intl: `_meta.json`, two namespaces in `en-Latn` and
   `ne-Deva-NP`, the MF2 subset parser, `validate`, `build`,
   `gen --target ts,dart`, a sliced pack's size.
4. Phase 1 design pages in `03-design/`: core catalogue, settings and
   profiles, ephemeris port, time and calendar, Teistro Intl engine; the
   five Phase 0 pages are the model.
5. Q24: conduct and security mailboxes on the Teispace domain.
6. Before Phase 1 exits: create `teispace/teistro-conformance` (CC0-1.0)
   and move `fixtures/` into it as a submodule (ADR-0022); the
   maintainer creates the repository.
7. Close the cruxes that block Phase 5 (C6 year length per system, C1,
   C2, C3, C8) by reading the texts; tradition reviewers as they appear.
8. A second baseline export (the same script, more sections) for the
   seventeen other dasha systems, aspects, yogas and doshas, strengths,
   Ashtakavarga, the Jaimini slice, KP and milan, once the design pages
   say what each fixture must carry; and the harness itself in Phase 1
   (`05-testing/01-golden-vectors.md`).

## Session log

| date | what happened |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-04 | The baseline engine analysis, Teimeris survey, competitive and platform research, docs written. Twenty-three questions compiled and decided by the maintainer the same day. Architecture revised for the astronomy layer, the built-in ephemeris and Teistro Intl; roadmap restructured into ten phases; governance and scaffolding written; the tooling made Rust-only (`xtask`) before the founding commit was finalised; repository `teispace/teistro-sdk` created public with the docs as the first commit and `main` protected. Next: spike 1, the golden-vector export from the baseline engine. |
| 2026-09-04 (second session) | A review of the team's earlier internal planning notes for the same SDK, now retired; everything worth keeping was absorbed into this repository in its own words and the notes are not referenced. Eight decisions (Q26 to Q33, ADR-0016 to ADR-0023), five falsified kernel and arithmetic designs, the cruxes register, the clean-room policy and dependency allow list, library lints, and the corresponding revisions across the architecture, quality bar, roadmap and guidelines. The maintainer added the type-safety mandate (Q33). Next: spike 1 unchanged. |
| 2026-09-04 (third session) | Spike 1 done: the export script written beside the baseline engine and run; 55 charts (48 chosen adversarially, 7 placed by search at classification boundaries in the topocentric frame), 115 fixtures under 13 settings profiles in `fixtures/baseline/`; the fixtures README with the schema and ten baseline conventions for the deliberate-difference registry; the provisional central tolerance file; `cargo xtask check-fixtures` in the fast check; `05-testing/01-golden-vectors.md` as the result page. Findings: the natal panchanga is topocentric while the daily one is geocentric; local mean time is rounded to the minute; Placidus above the polar circle is not flagged degenerate. Next: spike 2, the binding toolchain. |
