# Status

The living tracker. Read this first in any session; update it before ending
one. It answers four questions: what is done, what is being done now, what
comes next, and what happened in each session.

**Project phase:** Phase 0 exited on 2026-09-05 (decisions made, four
spikes measured, repository live); Phase 1, Foundation, begins with its
design pages.
**Repository:** https://github.com/teispace/teistro-sdk (public,
Apache-2.0, created 2026-09-04). `main` is protected: pull requests with
the `fast-check` status, linear history. Changes land by branch, pull
request (the `dco` and `fast-check` jobs), rebase merge.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-05, end of the seventh session (the five Phase 1
foundation design pages written: core types and the catalogue, settings
and profiles, time and time zones, the arithmetic calendars, Bikram
Sambat; Phase 1 implementation begins with `crates/core`).

## How to resume

1. Read this file, then `QUESTIONS.md` (every decision, one open question).
2. The local checkout is the repository root; `cargo xtask check-docs`
   and `cargo deny check` must pass before any commit; commits are
   signed off (`git commit -s`) with Conventional Commits subjects; the
   clean-room policy (`CLEAN_ROOM.md`) is binding.
3. The next task is `crates/core` (the first Phase 1 crate) from its
   design page. Spike 1 is done: its fixtures are in
   `fixtures/baseline/` (read `fixtures/README.md` before touching them;
   `cargo xtask check-fixtures` is their gate); the export script lives
   inside the baseline engine's own repository, in that repository's
   language, uncommitted there unless the maintainer asks, and is run
   again only for a deliberate corpus version bump. Spike 2 is done: the
   toolchain is option A (ADR-0007) and `spikes/02-binding-toolchain/`
   holds the model for the Phase 1 extractor and generators. Spike 3 is
   done: `spikes/03-ephemeris-port/port` is the model for the Phase 1
   `ephemeris` module and its kit; the two adapters there are standalone
   crates outside the workspace (ADR-0019) and need the engines locally
   (`TEIMERIS_LIB_DIR`, `SWEPH_SRC_DIR`; see the spike's README). Spike 4
   is done: `spikes/04-teistro-intl/intl` is the model for the Phase 1
   `intl` crate and the `teistro-intl` CLI; its harnesses need Node with
   `npm install` and Dart with `dart pub get` (see the spike's README).

## Done

- 2026-09-04: In-depth analysis of the baseline engine's backend (the reference and
  minimum bar). Recorded in `01-research/baseline-engine/`.
- 2026-09-04: Surface read of Teimeris (the default native ephemeris and
  the model for rigour and generated bindings).
- 2026-09-04: Web research on competitor feature sets and platform
  technology (Diplomat, UniFFI, ICU4X, MessageFormat 2, docs frameworks,
  WebAssembly, next-intl, slang, VSOP87 and ELP theories, Astronomy
  Engine, Swiss sidereal modes).
- 2026-09-04: Documentation written and revised: 86 pages (vision,
  research, architecture, roadmap, decisions, guidelines, living files).
- 2026-09-04: Twenty-five questions put to the maintainer and all
  decided; fifteen ADRs, fourteen accepted (0007, the binding generator,
  waits for the spike).
- 2026-09-04: The quality bar made binding (`05-testing/01-quality-bar.md`,
  ADR-0015) and landed through pull request #1, which proved the `dco` and
  `fast-check` path; `main` is at two commits.
- 2026-09-04: Open-source scaffolding: Apache-2.0 licence, `NOTICE`,
  `DCO`, Contributor Covenant 2.1, security policy, governance,
  `CODEOWNERS`, issue and pull request templates, RFC process, the Rust
  workspace with the `xtask` crate holding the documentation gate
  (`cargo xtask check-docs`) and the DCO check (`cargo xtask check-dco`),
  and the `fast-check` workflow (format, lint, tests, gates). Repository
  created and configured.
- 2026-09-04 (second session): eight further decisions recorded and
  accepted (ADR-0016 exact classification and periods, 0017 kernel and
  table, 0018 evidence ranks and mark-and-continue, 0019 clean room and
  licence containment, 0020 calculation version and provenance, 0021 the
  reference-accuracy ephemeris path, 0022 the determinism contract and
  the conformance repository, 0023 type safety in every binding); five
  design pages written in Phase 0 because they are retrofit-hostile
  (`03-design/`: exact arithmetic, dasha kernels with 56 systems as rows,
  the varga kernel, strength schemes, the rules engine v2); the
  verification-cruxes register (26 open items); `CLEAN_ROOM.md`,
  `deny.toml` with `cargo deny` in the fast check, library lints, the
  forbidden-terms gate extended; principles 16 to 18; the roadmap,
  quality bar, data model, API conventions, binding, performance,
  calendar, localisation, extensibility, guideline and glossary pages
  revised accordingly; `08-adding-a-dasha-system.md` written.
- 2026-09-04 (third session): spike 1 done. The golden-vector export
  script written in the baseline engine's repository and run: 55 charts
  (48 chosen for zone, latitude, altitude and data-range hostility, 7
  placed by search to the second at classification boundaries in the
  topocentric frame), 115 fixtures under 13 settings profiles, 8.9 MB,
  in `fixtures/baseline/` with a manifest; `fixtures/README.md` (layout,
  provenance, the chart set, the profiles, the schema, ten baseline
  conventions for the deliberate-difference registry);
  `fixtures/tolerances.json` (provisional, keyed by field and provider
  class); `cargo xtask check-fixtures` in the fast check;
  `05-testing/01-golden-vectors.md` as the spike's result page; the
  roadmap, testing map, glossary, layout and the varga and dasha design
  pages updated.
- 2026-09-05 (fourth session): spike 2 done. The same slice (a context,
  settings, the ephemeris port as a host callback, one batch call
  returning a tree) built both ways under `spikes/02-binding-toolchain/`:
  option A as a designed C ABI, an extractor over its Rust source, and
  Rust emitters for the C header, the napi glue, TypeScript, the blob
  decoder and Dart, with hand-written ergonomic layers; option B as a
  Diplomat bridge generated into JavaScript (wasm) and Dart. Measured
  in Node and Dart: callbacks, marshalling of trees to depth 5, code
  volume, the typed surface. Decided as option A (ADR-0007, Q2): Diplomat
  0.16 cannot pass a host provider from JavaScript or Dart, marshals
  trees only through per-node accessors (an order of magnitude slower
  than the blob), and serves Node only through wasm. The maintainer's
  mandate of the day (type safe, DRY, clean, no repetition) recorded in
  the coding standards; the spike's emitters share one `common` module
  and the benchmarks one harness per language.
- 2026-09-05 (fifth session): spike 3 done. The ephemeris port built
  under `spikes/03-ephemeris-port/`: the model (frames packed to 32
  bits, columns instants outermost, a status and a source per cell,
  capabilities with content hashes, reserved error codes), the trait
  with positions required and three overrides, the `#[repr(C)]` vtable
  with `struct_size` handshakes and a bit-identical round trip, the IAU
  2006 obliquity and IAU 2000B nutation ported from ERFA (`NOTICE`
  updated), frame completion by policy with stamped steps, a
  thirteen-check conformance kit under one published set of bounds, a
  shared kit runner and timing helper, and two adapters outside the
  workspace: Teimeris (one context behind a mutex, the body-major grid
  transposed) and the Swiss Ephemeris (compiled from `SWEPH_SRC_DIR`,
  one process-wide lock, explicit flags, fallback reported as missing
  data, hashed data, a cross-thread stress test). All three providers
  pass the kit; the two engines give the same numbers on every check;
  the port costs 0.2 % over Teimeris's own call, the vtable 1.8 %, and
  completion 0.16 to 0.32 µs per cell. Finding: the SDK's Delta T fit is
  5 s high by 2025 against the engines' tables, so Phase 1's Delta T is
  a table plus a model. The design page
  `03-design/ephemeris-port-and-adapters.md` written; the architecture,
  roadmap, spikes index and testing pages updated.
- 2026-09-05 (sixth session): spike 4 done. Teistro Intl built under
  `spikes/04-teistro-intl/`: the stable `MessageFormat 2` grammar in
  full (data model, parser with offsets and the data-model checks,
  serialiser with a property-tested round trip), the `i18n/`
  conventions (metadata, namespaces, keys, entity records, source
  order), the engine with the SDK's functions (`:string`, `:integer`,
  `:number`, `:dms`, `:zodiac`, `:entity`, `:list`, `:msg`), ICU4X plural
  rules, numbering systems, fallback chains with provenance and a parse
  cache, the validator with twelve proven gates, the `.tpack` container
  (zero-copy, checksummed, hashed, carrying the locale metadata), typed
  accessor generators for TypeScript and Dart over one model, the CLI
  (`validate`, `build`, `gen`, `render`, `report`), 49 entities and 13
  messages in `en-Latn` and `ne-Deva-NP`, and harnesses proving both
  surfaces compile and reject wrong usages. Findings: the stable syntax
  differs from the draft the architecture quoted; no parameter sidecar
  is needed; entities select on their own gender; Nepali ordinals need
  exact keys; packs keep source text and the Phase 1 container bundles a
  locale's namespaces. The design page `03-design/intl-engine-and-packs.md`
  written; the localisation architecture, design index, spikes index,
  roadmap, adding-a-language guide and glossary updated. Phase 0's exit
  criteria met.
- 2026-09-05 (seventh session): the five Phase 1 foundation design
  pages written in `03-design/`: core types and the catalogue (forty
  kinds, keys and ids with their C packing, the catalogue sources and
  generator, the three rules separating facts from school choices and
  presentation, the quantity newtypes, closed unions per binding, the
  envelope and status codes, registries and limits); settings and
  profiles (the typed knob inventory, profiles as patches over a cited
  root, coherence rules, the canonical form and hash, five shipped
  profiles including `conformance-baseline` for the fixtures); time
  and time zones (scales, Delta T as a table then a model, zone
  resolution with replay-safe metadata, local mean time, the local
  day, ghati-pala as exact integer arithmetic); the arithmetic
  calendars (the fixed day, Reingold and Dershowitz, the mixed
  transition, ISO weeks, exhaustive and differential tests); Bikram
  Sambat (table plus computed extension with the month-start rule
  chosen by measurement, the divergence set as a fixture, eras by
  new-year rules, the source memo). The calendar and data-model
  architecture pages and the design index updated.

## Decided (all on 2026-09-04 unless dated)

Rust core with a C ABI. Generated bindings with a parity gate, generator
chosen by spike. v1.0 is baseline parity with Western and Hellenistic
designed in. Apache-2.0 open core. Teispace owns all baseline engine content and
the baseline engine will migrate onto the SDK. A built-in analytic ephemeris in three
tiers (`standard` default) ships in v1 as its own phase. The SDK owns the
entire astronomy layer above raw positions; provider overrides
`prefer-native` by default. Calendars at least at the baseline engine's level in v1.
Teistro Intl as the single localisation standard (base locale `en-Latn`,
JSON, `i18n/<locale>/<namespace>.json`), offered to consumers too.
Fumadocs. British spelling. Precision-first `f64`. Two-person team,
public repository. Teimeris updated as needed. Names as recommended.
Binding order Node native, wasm, Dart/Flutter, Python, Rust, Java. DCO and
Conventional Commits. Eclipses and the full star catalogue in v1.x.
Everything we author is Rust, tooling included (`cargo xtask`). The
quality bar (tests, benchmarks, memory and leak checks, size and coverage
gates) is part of "done" for every module (ADR-0015). Second session:
`f64` astronomy with canonical nanoarcsecond angles, exact integer
classification and exact rational dasha spans (ADR-0016); one kernel per
family with systems as cited rows, falsified before code, and a lazy dasha
cursor (ADR-0017); evidence ranks with V/T/S marks and refusal of
unsourced variants (ADR-0018); a clean-room policy, a licence allow list
and adapter containment (ADR-0019); a calculation version and the
extended envelope (ADR-0020); the IAU routines as an ERFA port, a DE file
reader and a DE-refit `reference` tier (ADR-0021); byte identity across
architectures by hash and a separate CC0 conformance repository
(ADR-0022); type safety with generated, documented surfaces in every
binding (ADR-0023).

## Now

- Phase 1 implementation, first crate: `crates/core` from
  `03-design/core-types-and-catalogue.md`: the catalogue sources
  (`catalogue/*.yaml`, cited from the baseline engine's data at rank 2),
  the generator (`cargo xtask gen catalogue`) and its gate, the kinds'
  enums and attribute tables, the quantity newtypes with `trybuild`
  tests, `Nas` and `Ratio` from `exact-arithmetic.md`, the envelope,
  status codes, registries and limits; then `core::settings` from
  `settings-and-profiles.md`.

## Next

1. `crates/core` as above (it is "Now"), then `crates/time` and
   `crates/calendar` (Gregorian, Julian, mixed, ISO week, Bikram
   Sambat with its source memo `docs/calendars/bikram-sambat.md`), then
   the ports.
2. ADR-0007's consequences into `02-architecture/07-binding-architecture.md`
   in Phase 1: the blob encoding as the designed wire format, finaliser-
   backed handles with explicit `dispose`, the `api:` metadata line as
   the description's source, generated decoders.
3. Spike 3's consequences in Phase 1: the `ephemeris` module from the
   spike's port (`spikes/03-ephemeris-port/port`), the kit with the
   corpus checks, Delta T as a table plus a model in
   `time-and-timezone.md`, and the Teimeris adapter as the Teimeris
   package's own crate.
4. Spike 4's consequences in Phase 1: the `intl` crate and the
   `teistro-intl` CLI from the spike's crate, the locale bundle
   container, the calendar-aware `:date` family, rich renderers per
   binding, and `migrate baseline` into the entity namespace.
5. Q24: conduct and security mailboxes on the Teispace domain.
6. Before Phase 1 exits: create `teispace/teistro-conformance` (CC0-1.0)
   and move `fixtures/` into it as a submodule (ADR-0022); the
   maintainer creates the repository.
7. Close the cruxes that block Phase 5 (C6 year length per system, C1,
   C2, C3, C8) by reading the texts; tradition reviewers as they appear.
8. A second baseline export (the same script, more sections) for the
   seventeen other dasha systems, aspects, yogas and doshas, strengths,
   Ashtakavarga, the Jaimini slice, KP and milan, once the design pages
   say what each fixture must carry; and the harness itself in Phase 1
   (`05-testing/01-golden-vectors.md`).

## Session log

| date | what happened |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-04 | The baseline engine analysis, Teimeris survey, competitive and platform research, docs written. Twenty-three questions compiled and decided by the maintainer the same day. Architecture revised for the astronomy layer, the built-in ephemeris and Teistro Intl; roadmap restructured into ten phases; governance and scaffolding written; the tooling made Rust-only (`xtask`) before the founding commit was finalised; repository `teispace/teistro-sdk` created public with the docs as the first commit and `main` protected. Next: spike 1, the golden-vector export from the baseline engine. |
| 2026-09-04 (second session) | A review of the team's earlier internal planning notes for the same SDK, now retired; everything worth keeping was absorbed into this repository in its own words and the notes are not referenced. Eight decisions (Q26 to Q33, ADR-0016 to ADR-0023), five falsified kernel and arithmetic designs, the cruxes register, the clean-room policy and dependency allow list, library lints, and the corresponding revisions across the architecture, quality bar, roadmap and guidelines. The maintainer added the type-safety mandate (Q33). Next: spike 1 unchanged. |
| 2026-09-04 (third session) | Spike 1 done: the export script written beside the baseline engine and run; 55 charts (48 chosen adversarially, 7 placed by search at classification boundaries in the topocentric frame), 115 fixtures under 13 settings profiles in `fixtures/baseline/`; the fixtures README with the schema and ten baseline conventions for the deliberate-difference registry; the provisional central tolerance file; `cargo xtask check-fixtures` in the fast check; `05-testing/01-golden-vectors.md` as the result page. Findings: the natal panchanga is topocentric while the daily one is geocentric; local mean time is rounded to the minute; Placidus above the polar circle is not flagged degenerate. Next: spike 2, the binding toolchain. |
| 2026-09-05 (fourth session) | Spike 2 done and decided: option A (ADR-0007). The slice, a designed C ABI with a result blob, a Rust extractor and five emitters sharing one rules module, generated and hand-written Node and Dart layers, a Diplomat bridge with its JavaScript (wasm) and Dart outputs, one benchmark harness per language, and four result files under `spikes/02-binding-toolchain/`. Findings: Diplomat 0.16 refuses host callbacks in JavaScript and Dart; a C-ABI callback costs 0.5 µs into JavaScript and 0.1 µs into Dart; a depth-3 tree marshals in 6 µs as a blob against 179 µs as accessors; Diplomat's Dart output emitted the keyword `true` as an enum member. The maintainer's mandate (type safe, DRY, clean, no repetition) recorded. Next: spike 3, the ephemeris port. |
| 2026-09-05 (fifth session) | Spike 3 done: the ephemeris port under `spikes/03-ephemeris-port/`, a port crate in the workspace (model, trait, C vtable, ERFA-ported obliquity and nutation, frame completion by policy, a thirteen-check kit, runner, timing helper, `.se1` scanner, the spike-2 test provider behind the port) and two standalone adapters outside it (Teimeris; the Swiss Ephemeris compiled from `SWEPH_SRC_DIR` under the containment rules, with the cross-thread stress test). Three providers pass the same kit; the engines agree to every printed digit; the port costs 0.2 % over Teimeris's own call and 1.8 % through the vtable. Findings: the SDK's Delta T fit is 5 s stale by 2025 (Phase 1 uses a table plus a model); Teimeris's grid is body-major and its ayanamsha call takes only the no-nutation switch; the mean ayanamsha is the override to expose. The design page written; `NOTICE` gains ERFA. Next: spike 4, Teistro Intl. |
| 2026-09-05 (sixth session) | Spike 4 done: Teistro Intl under `spikes/04-teistro-intl/`, the stable `MessageFormat 2` grammar with the SDK's functions and ICU4X plurals, the `i18n/` conventions on 49 entities and 13 messages in English and Nepali, a validator with twelve proven gates, the `.tpack` container, typed accessors for TypeScript and Dart with harnesses that reject wrong usages, and the CLI. Measured: renders 0.5 to 2.7 µs, a 6 KB pack verified in 1.4 µs, a lookup in 0.46 µs. Findings: stable syntax over the draft, no parameter sidecar, entities select on their own gender, exact ordinal keys for Nepali, source text in packs with a locale bundle to come. The design page written; Phase 0 exited. Next: the Phase 1 design pages (core types and catalogue first). |
| 2026-09-05 (seventh session) | The five Phase 1 foundation design pages written in `03-design/` (core types and the catalogue, settings and profiles, time and time zones, the arithmetic calendars, Bikram Sambat), each following the ten-section template with a data model, algorithms, an API, errors, a budget, tests, localisation and open questions; the architecture pages they settle and the design index updated. Decisions recorded: the lagna is a point, not a graha; school-dependent values are kernel rows, never catalogue attributes; only the resolved settings are hashed; Delta T is a table then a model; `Resolution` gains `Defined`; Bikram Sambat's month-start rule is chosen by measurement against the official table. Next: `crates/core`. |
